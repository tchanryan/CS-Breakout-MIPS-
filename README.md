# CS-Breakout-MIPS-
A game of Breakout takes place on a 2D grid, where the player must move a paddle to bounce a ball (*) into a group of bricks (digits).  You can move the paddle left (a and A) and right (d and D).  Hitting bricks with the ball will destory the bricks, and reward the player with score points.
